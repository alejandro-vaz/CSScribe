/h3 User guide/n
Now that you have everything installed, you can start using ·CSScribe.· The first step to open an empty folder and create a /cd.cssc/cd file./n
Now you can start writing something. Try writing something like:/n
/code-cssc
/h¬2 Hello world!
/code/n
You''ll see that the whole line is colored blue (by the way, you can change all colors in the argument you copied to /cdsettings.json/cd). The /cd/h¬2/cd modifier is transformed into a medium header once the code is compiled./n
Since this is a markup language, everything you write is converted into text, unless so-called commands. You''ll find a cheatsheet (/cdcheatsheet.pdf/cd) which includes all possible commands, learn them to exploit all the features of ·CSScribe.·/n
Once you have the file ready, the first thing you have to do is to compile the /cd.cssc/cd. Compiling is really easy: run /cdcompiler.py/cd in the same folder you''re in and input the file name. Shortly after (quite literally, milliseconds), a /cd.md/cd file with the same name as the original file will appear./n
To transform that file to a pretty, print-friendly file, you will have to open the /cd.md/cd file inside ·VSC.· Then press /cdCtrl + Shift + V/cd simultaneously to open the file in the ·Markdown Preview Enhanced· extension. Don''t worry about what you see inside there, just right-click, click on /cdExport/cd and then select /cdPDF (Prince)/cd./n
The formatted ·PDF· file will be created shortly after. However, it will undoubtedly be very ugly. That''s because you haven''t customized the ·CSS.·/n
Don''t worry, I have already done so for you. Inside the extension folder you''ll find another folder named /cdstyle//cd. Copy the code inside one of the many /cdstyle.less/cd files and paste it into /cdMarkdown Preview Enhanced: Customize CSS (Global)/cd (you might be prompted to create the file)./n
Inside the /cd.less/cd file you''ll also see at the top variables you can modify, feel free to modify them but you might not want to dive deep into the /_300/_ lines of code I barely understand (with a lot of /cd!important/cd lines because ·PrinceXML· doesn''t always like margins)./n
Compile it again and you''ll have a beautifully looking document./n
/> You can access different fonts by replacing the variable value in the /cd.less/cd file. There are some font files already in the /cdfonts//cd folder./n
/h3 Custom environments/n
For larger projects, you might want to use a custom environment which includes scripts and stuff which will help you organize your project. The /cdbuilder.py/cd utility will do so automatically. This feature is under development but it is working really well./n
/> Be careful when you execute /cdbuilder.py/cd, it will delete all files in the current folder, make sure to select a folder exclusively for the environment./n
