/h3 User guide/n
Now that you have everything installed, you can start using ·CSScribe.· The first step to open an empty folder and create a /_.cssc/_ file./n
Now you can start writing something. Try writing something like::/n
/code-cssc
/h¬2 Hello world!
---/¬n
/code/n
You'll see that the whole line is colored blue. The /_/h¬2/_ modifier is transformed into a medium header once the code is compiled./n
Since this is a markup language, everything you write is converted into text, unless so-called commands. This [link](https:://csscribe.ct.ws) will teach you all possible commands, learn them to exploit all the features of ·CSScribe.·/n
Once you have the file ready, the first thing you have to do is to compile the /_.cssc/_. Compiling is really easy:: run /_compiler.py/_ in the same folder you're in and input the file name. Shortly after (quite literally, milliseconds), a /_.md/_ file with the same name as the original file will appear./n
To transform that file to a pretty, print-friendly file, you will have to open the /_.md/_ file inside ·VSC.· Then press /_Ctrl + Shift + V/_ simultaneously to open the file in the ·Markdown Preview Enhanced· extension. Don't worry about what you see inside there, just right-click, click on /_Export/_ and then select /_PDF (Prince)/_./n
The formatted ·PDF· file will be created shortly after. However, it will undoubtedly be very ugly. That's because you haven't customized the ·CSS.·/n
Don't worry, I have already done so for you. Inside the extension folder you'll find another folder named /_style//_. Copy the code inside one of the many /_style.less/_ files and paste it into /_Markdown Preview Enhanced:: Customize CSS (Global)/_ (you might be prompted to create the file)./n
Inside the /_.less/_ file you'll also see at the top variables you can modify, feel free to modify them but you might not want to dive deep into the /_300/_ lines of code I barely understand (with a lot of /_!important/_ lines because ·PrinceXML· doesn't always like margins)./n
Compile it again and you'll have a beautifully looking document./n
/& You can access different fonts by replacing the variable value in the /_.less/_ file. There are some font files already in the /_fonts//_ folder./n
/h3 Custom environments/n
For larger projects, you might want to use a custom environment which includes scripts and stuff which will help you organize your project. The /_builder.py/_ utility will do so automatically. This feature is under development but it is working really well./n
/& Be careful when you execute /_builder.py/_, it will delete all files in the current folder, make sure to select a folder exclusively for the environment./n
/h3 License/n

You're allowed to use the source code to write anything, without the need to mention me or ·CSScribe· (but I'll appreciate it a lot)./n
